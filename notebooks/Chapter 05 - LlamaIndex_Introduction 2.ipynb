Beyond comedy he was also a dare-devil and stunt performer in the television variety show Sabado Sensacional. In 2006 Rausseo was studying law and was one semester from graduating with a JD from the Universidad Santa María de Caracas. Rausseo owns a theme park in Isla Margarita called Musipán.\\n\\n\\n== Presidential aspirations ==\\nIn July 2006, he announced that he was running for president under his newly formed \"Piedra Party,\" as a protest against the state of politics in Venezuela, and to challenge the presidency of Hugo Chavez.\\nThree weeks before the election, in accordance with a campaign pledge he had made earlier (to stand down if not placed first or second in the opinion polls), he withdrew his candidacy without endorsing either Chávez or Rosales, telling his supporters to vote for either.\\nRausseo was an independent candidate in the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election. After the National Electoral Council (CNE) declared Nicholas Maduro the winner with 51.2% of the vote, Rausseo congratulated Maduro and called on the opposition parties to support dialogue, reunion and reconciliation.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nMusipan Theme Park Official Site', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')"

In 2011, she campaigned as a promotor of \"popular capitalism\". Machado supports the privatization of state-run entities in Venezuela, including oil company PDVSA. Machado has supported the international sanctions during the Venezuelan crisis, and has advocated for foreign intervention to remove Maduro on humanitarian grounds. In 2023, she ran as a candidate in the opposition presidential primaries. The authoritarian Maduro regime subsequently barred her from running. She subsequently became the main driving force for the main opposition candidate, Edmundo González, who was allowed to compete by the Maduro regime.\\nShe has described herself as a centrist liberal, saying in an interview with El Estímulo that the categories of left and right were invented by Marxists and that she is the only non-socialist politician in the Venezuelan political spectrum. Machado said: \"We are a centre liberal party, so they say it is from the extreme right, because for the Marxists if you are not from the left you are from the ultra right, but Vente is a party of centre liberals.\" She also stated that the division of the country and life between rich and poor sought to manipulate, simplify and appeal to populism as a control of the person and the individual. Machado has been described as a radical and a right-wing politician by some media outlets.\\nDomestically, Machado has called for the banning of reelection to political offices in Venezuela, is in favor of same-sex marriage in Venezuela, supports the legalization of medical cannabis, and has called on a national debate regarding the legality of abortion. She believes that those who have more, should give more, and defended the saying that \"being rich is good\"; she criticized Hugo Chávez, saying that \"Chávez was the president of the poor, yes, very poor that he loved them, because there is no more effective way to control a society than to subject it to dependency. Dying with outstretched hand.\"\\nIn a 2024 interview Machado talked of making education available for all Venezuelans, and of reforming the Venezuelan judiciary.\\n\\n\\n== Target of violence ==\\nDescribed as a Lady of Steel, or Iron Lady, The New York Times states that supporters see her as \"courageous for staying in Venezuela when many other politicians have fled\".\\nWhile attending the bicentennial celebration of Venezuela\\'s Declaration of Independence on 5 July 2011, following controversial comments made earlier by Machado about Venezuela\\'s dependency on Cuba and not being independent, Machado was attacked by an angry group of Venezuelan government supporters. The group of about 50 threw stones and bottles at her; authorities defended her, and one officer was injured, as Machado was evacuated from the area by a police motorbike. Machado later thanked the authorities for defending her and apologized for any of their injuries. \\nDuring Machado\\'s presidential race in 2011, she and her companions were attacked on 16 October by a small group of the Motorized Front of the PSUV while in Turmero, injuring Machado and two others. The group attacked them with kicks, punches and objects while saying \"this is chavista territory, no political opposition enters here\".\\nOn 30 April 2013, cameras covering the National Assembly were turned to the ceiling and opposition members stated they were attacked and assaulted in an \"ambush by supporters of President Nicolas Maduro\\'s government\". Machado was injured, along with other legislators in the National Assembly, saying she was attacked from behind, hit in the face and kicked while on the floor which left her with a broken nose. Machado said the brawl \"was a premeditated, cowardly, vile, aggression\". Maduro responded to the situation by saying: \"What happened today in the National Assembly, we do not agree with violence. They tell us and we knew that the opposition was coming to provoke violence.\" No disciplinary actions was taken against any of the attackers after the incident.\\nAt a rally on 16 November 2013 showing support for the opposition party during municipal elections, Machado and other politicians were attacked by government supporters, with stones and fireworks. \\nAfter leading protests in Bolivar state on 14 March 2014, Machado, the Bishop of Ciudad Guayana, Mariano Parra, and other citizens in the area were attacked at the Puerto Ordaz airport. The National Guard intervened to disperse the attack. \\nWhile heading to a meeting in Caricuao on 30 July 2014, members of colectivos attacked Machado. The vehicle Machado was traveling in was heavily damaged, with the body and windows of the vehicle being struck with gun handles, sticks and stones. Machado escaped and was then moved to the assembly place while colectivos followed breaking down the door where they then left the scene after confrontations with residents protecting Machado.\\n\\n=== 2023 presidential primary elections ===\\nOn 14 August 2022, Machado confirmed her participation in the 2023 Unitary Platform presidential primaries. During the primaries, Machado positioned herself against the technical assistance of the National Electoral Council (CNE) in the election, alleging that CNE is part of a \"criminal system. In the same way, she  defended the return to manual voting. On 15 March 2023, she officially began her campaign tour of the country, in the State of Mérida. During her pre-campaign, Machado maintained criticism towards the traditional opposition leadership, mainly the Democratic Action, Justice First, A New Era, and Popular Will parties. She also made it clear that she was willing to negotiate an exit from Chavismo to achieve a transition.\\nOn 30 June 2023, she was disqualified for fifteen years by the Comptroller General of Venezuela, after a request from the politician José Brito. The comptroller linked her to alleged crimes by Juan Guaidó and accused her of supporting sanctions during the Venezuelan crisis. Analysts determined that the accusation of having participated in the interim was incoherent, taking into account that she was not a member of the 2015 opposition National Assembly (being prevented by a disqualification from the Comptroller\\'s Office), in addition to never having been appointed in any position in Guaidó\\'s interim government. Organizations like the United Nations, the Organization of American States, and the European Union, as well as countries such as Colombia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Chile, Canada, and France, rejected the disqualification of Machado. The European Union Parliament called the ban \"arbitrary and politically fabricated\", and the Associated Press stated the banning opposing politicians from elections is a frequent tactic used by the government.\\nOn 26 October 2023, after winning the primary elections, the National Primary Commission proclaimed Machado as the unitary presidential candidate of the opposition.\\nMachado\\'s 15-year disqualification was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Justice of Venezuela in January 2024. The court said the disqualification was \"for being involved... in the corruption plot orchestrated by the usurper Juan Guaido\", which had led to a \"criminal blockade of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, as well as the shameless dispossession of the companies and wealth of the Venezuelan people abroad, with the complicity of corrupt governments\".\\nMachado named Corina Yoris as her alternate. Yoris was unable to register as a candidate and named Edmundo González Urrutia as her temporary replacement.\\n\\n\\n=== 2024 presidential election ===\\n\\nEven though Machado is not the presidential candidate, she has remained the leader of the opposition to Chavismo during the electoral process. The majority support that candidate Edmundo González receives in various polls is due to the boost given to him by the Machado support.\\nRegarding the role that Machado will play in a hypothetical González Urrutia government, The Telegraph comments \"Should the opposition win, Ms Machado is widely expected to be the de facto leader of a government formally led by Mr González\". The newspaper also compared the massive popular movement around Machado, with the rise of Hugo Chávez to the presidency in 1998, in terms of the \"fervor\" it generates in citizens, both in a context of political crisis and decadence of the system.\\nOn July 4, González and Machado officially began the electoral campaign along with other opposition leaders. The event, which was planned to be a caravan from Chacaíto to El Marqués, became a march with the attendance of dozens of thousands of people.\\nThe New York Times, referring to Machado, described her as \"an energetic former legislator whose central message is the promise of bringing Venezuelans home by restoring democracy and getting the economy going again\".\\nOn 1 August, Machado published a letter in The Wall Street Journal, stating that she had gone in to hiding \"fearing for my life, my freedom, and that of my fellow countrymen from the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro\"; in the letter, she laid out the evidence she said she had from the vote tallies supporting PUD\\'s win, and stated that Maduro had expelled witnesses from the polls, while the witnesses \"protected the voter receipts with their lives throughout the night\" of the elections.\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: What are the main policy differences between the two candidates?\\nAnswer: '}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}\n",

In 2011, she campaigned as a promotor of \"popular capitalism\". Machado supports the privatization of state-run entities in Venezuela, including oil company PDVSA. Machado has supported the international sanctions during the Venezuelan crisis, and has advocated for foreign intervention to remove Maduro on humanitarian grounds. In 2023, she ran as a candidate in the opposition presidential primaries. The authoritarian Maduro regime subsequently barred her from running. She subsequently became the main driving force for the main opposition candidate, Edmundo González, who was allowed to compete by the Maduro regime.\\nShe has described herself as a centrist liberal, saying in an interview with El Estímulo that the categories of left and right were invented by Marxists and that she is the only non-socialist politician in the Venezuelan political spectrum. Machado said: \"We are a centre liberal party, so they say it is from the extreme right, because for the Marxists if you are not from the left you are from the ultra right, but Vente is a party of centre liberals.\" She also stated that the division of the country and life between rich and poor sought to manipulate, simplify and appeal to populism as a control of the person and the individual. Machado has been described as a radical and a right-wing politician by some media outlets.\\nDomestically, Machado has called for the banning of reelection to political offices in Venezuela, is in favor of same-sex marriage in Venezuela, supports the legalization of medical cannabis, and has called on a national debate regarding the legality of abortion. She believes that those who have more, should give more, and defended the saying that \"being rich is good\"; she criticized Hugo Chávez, saying that \"Chávez was the president of the poor, yes, very poor that he loved them, because there is no more effective way to control a society than to subject it to dependency. Dying with outstretched hand.\"\\nIn a 2024 interview Machado talked of making education available for all Venezuelans, and of reforming the Venezuelan judiciary.\\n\\n\\n== Target of violence ==\\nDescribed as a Lady of Steel, or Iron Lady, The New York Times states that supporters see her as \"courageous for staying in Venezuela when many other politicians have fled\".\\nWhile attending the bicentennial celebration of Venezuela\\'s Declaration of Independence on 5 July 2011, following controversial comments made earlier by Machado about Venezuela\\'s dependency on Cuba and not being independent, Machado was attacked by an angry group of Venezuelan government supporters. The group of about 50 threw stones and bottles at her; authorities defended her, and one officer was injured, as Machado was evacuated from the area by a police motorbike. Machado later thanked the authorities for defending her and apologized for any of their injuries. \\nDuring Machado\\'s presidential race in 2011, she and her companions were attacked on 16 October by a small group of the Motorized Front of the PSUV while in Turmero, injuring Machado and two others.

      "Answer: The international relations for María Corina Machado are characterized by recognition and awards for her efforts in defending democratic institutions and civil liberties, as evidenced by her acceptance into the Yale World Fellows Program and awards such as the Cádiz Cortes Ibero-American Freedom Prize and the Prize for Freedom from Liberal International. On the other hand, the international relations for Nicolás Maduro are marked by sanctions imposed by various countries due to allegations of corruption, involvement in money laundering, and disregard for democratic principles, leading to his isolation from certain countries like the United States, Canada, Panama, and Colombia.\n",
